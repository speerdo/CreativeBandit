## About Section

### Main About Text
Current placeholder text talks about "premier digital agency" and "decade of experience"

**Your authentic version:**
I'm Adam Speer, founder of Creative Bandit. With over 8 years of full-stack development experience, I specialize in building AI-powered automation systems and modern web applications that solve real business problems. My background includes healthcare technology work at Eli Lilly (leading frontend migrations for pharmaceutical applications), developing HIPAA-compliant systems for Medicare billing compliance, and building scalable platforms at Salesforce that served thousands of users.

I work primarily with React, Vue.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and modern AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) to create intelligent systems that reduce manual work by 60-90%. Recent projects include AI-powered verification systems achieving 100% accuracy, automated marketing pipelines processing 1,000+ monthly transactions, and healthcare compliance automation for remote therapeutic monitoring.

Beyond client work, I build and operate my own web properties including DowntownDry (a nationwide alcohol-free venue directory) and RecycleOldTech.com (an electronics recycling directory with automated affiliate systems). I believe in creating solutions that deliver measurable business impact—whether that's eliminating hours of manual work, increasing conversion rates, or building platforms that scale to serve millions of users.
